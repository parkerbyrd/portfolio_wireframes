# Portfolio Wireframes

------------------------

Here, I took the three best sketches based on my opinion and class feedback and put them into Photoshop wireframes. 

The first one puts alot of focus on showcasing my work and my skills, as well as the implementation of a journal. This one is big on content.

The second is very similar to the first but with more focus on displaying work rather than blogs. Both this and the first have a large section about what I'm currently up to, giving people insight to my job and free time

The third is more relaxed, mainly just showing some work along with many side projects I work on, with easy ways to get in touch with me
